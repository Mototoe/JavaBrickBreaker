# JavaBrickBreaker
# Overview

I made this project to learn and gain a better understanding of the Java language. The project I made is an old school brick breaker game. I implemented an interface that starts the game when you move and can restart if you lose by pressing enter. In doing so I was able to fully explore different aspects of Java.

# Future Work

* One thing that I want to impove in the future is adding a difficulty setting and a main menu to go along with it.
* Add more more bricks or speed up the ball once you clear the first round of bricks
* Smothen out the bat or breaker bar so that it feels nicer to the user.
